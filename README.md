# Guess-my-number

Guess my number is a simple web based game where you have to guess the right number generated by the computer.

So, the user will basically have 20 points and whenever he/she will guess a wrong number, the score gets deducted by 1. 
By clicking the 'Again' button on top right corner, you can start the game again. 
The highscore will also be tracked until the page is reloded.
